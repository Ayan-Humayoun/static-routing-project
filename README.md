# Secure Multi Router Static Routing Implementatio for Enterprise Networks
A self-initiated networking project focused on mastering **static routing** concepts using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This lab demonstrates how routers manually forward data between different networks using administrator-defined paths, without using dynamic routing protocols.

* * * * *

🚀 Project Overview
-------------------

This project simulates static routing across multiple routers to enable communication between two end devices located in separate networks. Every route is manually configured, providing full control over network traffic and a deeper understanding of routing behavior.

* * * * *

🎯 Objectives
-------------

-   Understand the concept of static routing

-   Manually configure routing tables on each router

-   Establish connectivity between devices on different networks

-   Analyze packet flow across routers using simulation mode

* * * * *

🧠 Key Concepts Covered
-----------------------

-   IP addressing and subnetting

-   Default gateways and next-hop addresses

-   Static route configuration using CLI commands

-   Verifying connectivity with `ping` and `traceroute`

* * * * *

🛠️ Tools Used
--------------

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco Packet Tracer | Network simulation |
| CLI Interface | Router configuration |
| PCs & Routers | End devices and routing nodes |

📡 Network Topology (Example)
-----------------------------

`PC1 --- Router1 --- Router2 --- Router3 --- PC2`

Each router is configured with static routes pointing to the next hop to enable end-to-end communication.

* * * * *

🔧 Configuration Steps
----------------------

1.  **Assign IP addresses to interfaces**

2.  **Configure default gateways**

3.  **Add static routes using CLI commands**

4.  **Test network connectivity**

✅ *Example Command:*

`Router(config)# ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`

* * * * *

📊 Verification
---------------

Use the following commands:

`Router# show ip route
Router# ping <destination IP>
Router# traceroute <destination IP>`

These commands confirm that routing has been successfully configured.

* * * * *

📈 Learning Outcomes
--------------------

By completing this lab, you will:

-   Gain hands-on experience with static routing

-   Understand how routers determine the path of network traffic

-   Be able to design and troubleshoot static route configurations

* * * * *

✅ Conclusion
------------

This project is an essential step in building a strong foundation in networking. Manually configuring static routes builds the mindset of a network engineer, enabling you to understand underlying processes before moving on to dynamic routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP.
